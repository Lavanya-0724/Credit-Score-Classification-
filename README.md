# Credit Score Classification

This project is focused on classifying individuals based on their credit score using supervised machine learning techniques. The goal is to predict whether a person's credit score falls into one of several categories (e.g., good, average, poor) based on features such as income, age, credit history, and more.

## 📌 Project Overview
- **Problem Type:** Classification  
- **Approach:** Supervised Learning  
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Dataset:** Public dataset containing customer financial information and credit score labels.

## 🚀 Objectives
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset  
- Clean and preprocess the data (handling missing values, encoding, scaling, etc.)  
- Apply classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM)  
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix  
- Compare results and choose the best-performing model

## 🔍 Overview
The goal of this project is to build a model that predicts a person's credit score class using features such as income, credit history, loan amounts, etc.

Key steps involved:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Data Preprocessing  
- Model Building (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)  
- Evaluation using classification metrics  
- Flowchart to show the full process
