# Credit Score Classification

This project is focused on classifying credit scores using supervised machine learning techniques. The goal is to predict the credit score category (e.g., Good, Bad, Standard) for customers based on various financial and demographic features.

## Project Structure

- `Source Code/credit-score-classification.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing the data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `Source Code/train.csv` and `Source Code/test.csv`: Datasets used for training and testing the models.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.

## Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data preprocessing
- Implementation of multiple classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Neural Networks)
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Visualization of results

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository** and navigate to the project directory.
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the Jupyter notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Source\ Code/credit-score-classification.ipynb
   ```

## Usage

- Open the main notebook and follow the cells sequentially to perform EDA, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- You can modify the notebook to experiment with different models or preprocessing techniques.

## Data

The dataset contains features such as age, occupation, income, number of bank accounts, credit card usage, loan types, payment behavior, and more. The target variable is the credit score category.

## Requirements

See `requirements.txt` for the full list of dependencies.
